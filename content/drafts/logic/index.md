My absolute favorite class at Purdue was PHIL 150 Principles of Logic. I had to take the class when I briefly switched over to a CS degree. I want to go over the basics of what I learned because I love it so much.

## The pieces

Since this was a philosophy course, we learned a system for deducing a valid argument. An argument is composed of a series of statements, with each statement either something truthful or something false, like, "the sky is blue," for the former and, "the tomato is aqua," for the latter.

You can glue together statements with "and" and "or". So, "the sky is blue and the tomato is aqua." Think about any conjunctive sentence you'd normally say and notice where the "and"s and "or"s are.
