Whenever I hear about a company's diversity and inclusion initiatives, I expect to be disappointed. And that's a terrible thing to feel.

It's a difficult – and sometimes painful – thing to talk about. I wanted to write this to clarify my thoughts as a lesbian WOC frustrated in an industry that doesn't do enough.

I recently had a discussion with my mentor about my frustrations. For context, he is a white, wealthy, cis-gendered male (and that does matter). I started going on a rant that started with my previous company's lack of effort with their Diversity and Inclusion group and touched on like 15 other things that were related, but really just represented my level of frustration with everything. From this point on I'm going to shorten diversity and inclusion to D & I.

In Indianapolis, when you think about D & I in the workplace, you might think of meeting a certain hiring quota of candidates. Your company shouldn't be too white or too male or too insert-majority-here. Or you might think of mandatory courses with cringey videos and shitting acting to illustrate how not to be a sexist or racist in the workplace. Or you might think of panels with bigwigs in the industry telling people why D & I is important to the delight of those who've never heard it before. Those are all examples of perfectly safe ways to address D & I, but none of them really address the core issues that this country is struggling with.
