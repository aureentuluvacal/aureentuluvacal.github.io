title: Is being a hypocrite inevitable when leading a business?

I recently read an article on the [NY times about Airbnb's layoffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/airbnb-coronavirus-layoffs-.html) and there's a lot going on there. I think the natural inclination is to draw a line in the sand, pick a side, and vehemently attack the other side, which is how politics in this country is now. Everything is politicized and you never hear about anyone just fucking talking anymore. I know some people do, but you'd think from reading or watching the news that we're about to enter a civil war.

Anyway, the two sides in this article are the company (Airbnb) and their employees (the contractors). Basically, Airbnb was lauded for the CEOs "touching" and "human" firing of a quarter of its workforce. In an attempt to not be seen as complete hypocrites, they gave a very generous severance package to all of their full time employees, despite some contractors having longer tenure or list of responsibilities than full-time employees.

## More than just, "CAPITALISM BAD"

I think most people's struggle with capitalism is that it unfavorably benefits the people at the top. The C suite, the shareholders, not the working people. I also think the image in most peoples' minds are those scions of unregulated, predatory capitalism. Think of DeBeers or Exxon or Activision Blizzard or any of those companies that change their profile pic on social media to a rainbow but don't give a fuck about the LGBTQ+ community otherwise or those companies that adopted Juneteenth as a company holiday but don't give a fuck about black people otherwise. The virtue signalers.

Then I think about the other STAT NEEDED of companies that make less than a million dollars in annual revenue. That's the vast majority of businesses with founders and employees that aren't rolling in money
