> Trigger warning: descriptions of suicidal ideation, substance abuse, depression, and anxiety.

I just finished reading _The Deepest Well: Healing the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Adversity_ by Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, the Surgeon General of California (she's a bad bitch), and it got me thinking about my own experiences. I'll talk more about Dr. Burke Harris' book later on, but first I want to talk about reaching day 585 of sobriety today.

This site isn't intended as my diary, obviously, but I want to help destigmatize talking about substance abuse and depression. I am a smart and capable engineer, I'm learning how to be a better CTO every day, but I also had to struggle through my own severe mental health issues to get to where I am now. I promise not to make it too melodramatic.  

## Getting sober

I used to drink a lot of whiskey. It was my drink of choice, not only because I found it tasty but because it made me feel like I was drinking something only "tough" people drank. I was one of *those* douches. Even worse, I was a beer snob, too. I'm not sure if I was insufferable to be around when my drinking was really bad or if I hid it well (I don't remember), but no matter what I drank, I always drank too much.

Of course, I didn't think I had a problem at the time because it was the "normal" thing to do in college. You study, you party, you maybe blackout, then you do it all over again. 

I didn't realize I had a problem even when I drank vodka sodas to do my homework or when I immediately poured myself another drink because "I deserved it". I didn't realize I had a problem even when I couldn't stand the thought of people abandoning glasses half full of alcohol _that they paid for_ next to their signed checks at restaurants. I didn't realize I had a problem even when I terrified the girl I was seeing the first time I blacked out and had a seizure.  I didn't realize I had a problem even when I fractured my hand punching a wall or when I passed out and had a seizure for the third time. (Both of those happened on the same night.) 

And it kept going on like this for years.

So what finally got through my thick ass skull?

The morning of January 1st, 2019, after a night of heavy whiskey drinking, I woke up unable to feel my hands. I thought I had just slept wrong and maybe wedged them underneath me when I was rolling over in my sleep, but the numbness didn't fade immediately. It felt wrong, and after what felt like 20 minutes, I felt tingling.

At that time, I was already toying with the idea of quitting drinking. I had been to an AA meeting (hard pass) and talked about it in therapy and with friends, but I just couldn't let go of all the _fun_ I'd be quitting with the drink. However, that morning, I knew something was different. I just _knew_ I had to stop or I wouldn't be alive. 

## Discovering ACEs

I first heard of Dr. Nadine Burke Harris on Dax Shepard's podcast _Armchair Expert_. I was entralled. 

## Getting on meds

There's still a shit load of stigma when it comes to taking medicine for mental health issues.
