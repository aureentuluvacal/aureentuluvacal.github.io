This is it, the final equation.

I really wish I had used the differential forms of all these equations but it's been like a year so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯.

I'll start with the equation as usual, focus the middle of the post on some contextual knowledge, and end with an application of the law.

Let's begin!

$$ \oint \vec{B} \cdotp d\vec{L} = \mu_0 (I + \varepsilon_0{dE \over dt}) $$

We have:

- A magnetic field, $$\vec{B}$$, following any closed path, $$d\vec{L}$$
- Vacuum permeability, $$\mu_0$$
- A current, $$I_{enclosed}$$, enclosed by the path
- Permittivity of free space, \varepsilon_0
- And the change in electric flux over time

In other words, a magnetic field around an electric current is proportional to the electric current plus any displacement current.

## An experiment with magnets

If you've ever done that experiment where you ran a current through a wire and used a series of compasses to track the change in direction of the magnetic field, then you've encountered Ampere's Law. Here's an example:

Let's replicate this experiment and break it down.
