description: When companies reach a certain size, it's only a matter of time before they create their own UI library. But why wait? I think you should have a UI library from the get go.

I inherited a decently large codebase with _a lot_ of legacy code (Rails 4.2.7, Handlebars, and a lot of jQuery). In an effort to modernize the front end, there was a bit of React peppered in, but it was probably about 5% of the front end. I knew converting it all was going to be one of our years long projects, which was to be expected, and I wanted to make that process as painless as possible.
