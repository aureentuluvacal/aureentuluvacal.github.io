I know I wanted to keep a more regular cadence with posting, but life happens, as usual. We hired a new dev and a designer and are almost finished with version 3 of our engine (which is our product's core). Sounds like just two things but between the training, planning, redesigns, allocation of work, and actual development, I don't really recall the past two months in detail.

In other words, it's been busy as fuck.

I welcome it, though, because after our 3 month feature freeze to address technical debt, we're paying down even more debt by redoing something that's been a struggle to manage for years. I can't really go into detail about the architecture of the new engine but holy shit, is it easier to understand. We're releasing it next week!

On a more personal note, I've started learning French because I saw _Portrait of a Lady on Fire_ one time (cries in lesbian), finished my Grey Knight army so Irma and I can finally play 40K and shoot each other, and bought an iPad to get back to digital painting. I'm tossing around the idea of putting a gallery or creating a new Art tag on this site. I don't want to do commissions because it makes painting feel like work and I already work enough.

As far as posting goes, I'm going to start on an overview of electrical components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) since I finished the Maxwell's Equations series. I also plan on doing more math based posts so my math doesn't get rusty.

This post is a reminder to myself to keep writing.
