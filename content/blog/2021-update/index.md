Well since my last update, I've done fuck all with this site. However, I have:

- Started learning French
- Got a new job as a Senior Software Engineer at [Praxis Labs](https://praxislabs.co)
- Really got into woodworking and am currently making a custom Settlers of Catan board
- Removed the last of my social profiles (LinkedIn) so now my only online presence is this site
- Been painting a lot

I have so many ideas for blog posts and now I actually have the time to write!
