Quarantine boredom introduced me to Warhammer 40k. I had heard about it before but I didn't realize how deep the rabbit hole went, especially how much time and effort people put into painting their armies. I paint regularly, both oil and acrylic, but I never painted models before. That was a bridge of nerddom I had yet to cross. I'm so glad I did.

Irma actually wanted to play Warhammer with me. I showed her all the factions and she thought the Craftworld Eldar were the prettiest. I went with a color scheme similar to the [Mymeara Eldar](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Mymeara). I bought a Guardians set and the Start Collecting! box for the Eldar, which seemed right to me at the time. 

Honestly, I really am just winging it.

So here they are:

#### Wraithlord

#### War Walker

#### Heavy Weapon Platform

#### Farseer & Guardians

#### Wraithguards

Not bad for my first time. I decided on Grey Knights as my army because they seem like super paladins, which is very on brand for me. RIP Irma's army.

To keep up with the theme of complicated color schemes, I'm going to try painting their armor as damascus steel. It's going to be hard as fuck.
