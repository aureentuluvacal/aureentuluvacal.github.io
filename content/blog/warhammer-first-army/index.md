Quarantine boredom introduced me to Warhammer 40k. I had heard about it before but I didn't realize how deep the rabbit hole went, especially how much time and effort people put into painting their armies. I paint regularly, both oil and acrylic, but I never painted models before. That was a bridge of nerddom I had yet to cross. I'm so glad I did.

My partner actually wanted to play Warhammer with me (ðŸ˜­). I showed her all the factions and she thought the Craftworld Eldar were the prettiest. I went with a color scheme similar to the [Mymeara Eldar](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Mymeara) and bought Guardians set and the Start Collecting! box.

So here they are:

#### Wraithlord

#### War Walker

#### Heavy Weapon Platform

#### Farseer & Guardians

#### Wraithguards

Not bad for my first time. I also was able to magnetize the majority of the weapons so I can swap them out in the future (I truly am blindly following whatever is on the Warhammer 40k subreddit).

Next on my list is purchasing some Grey Knights. They seem like super paladins, which is very on brand for me. RIP Irma's army.

To keep up with the theme of complicated color schemes, I'm going to try painting their armor as damascus steel. Plain steel seems too boring.
