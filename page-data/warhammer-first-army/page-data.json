I had heard about it before but I didnâ€™t realize how deep the rabbit hole went, especially how much time and effort people put into painting their armies. I paint regularly, both oil and acrylic, but I never painted models before. That was a bridge of nerddom I had yet to cross. Iâ€™m so glad I did.</p>\n<p>Irma actually wanted to play Warhammer with me (ðŸ˜­). I showed her all the factions and she thought the Craftworld Eldar were the prettiest. I went with a color scheme similar to the <a href=\"https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Mymeara\">Mymeara Eldar</a> and bought Guardians set and the Start Collecting! box.</p>\n<p>So here they are:</p>\n<h4>Wraithlord</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/caryssa-perez-images/posts/wraithlord.jpg\" alt=\"Wraithlord\"></p>\n<h4>War Walker</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/caryssa-perez-images/posts/warwalker.jpg\" alt=\"Wraithlord\"></p>\n<h4>Heavy Weapon Platform</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/caryssa-perez-images/posts/heavyweapon.jpg\" alt=\"Wraithlord\"></p>\n<h4>Farseer &#x26; Guardians</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/caryssa-perez-images/posts/farseer_guardians.jpg\" alt=\"Wraithlord\"></p>\n<h4>Wraithguards</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/caryssa-perez-images/posts/wraithguard.jpg\" alt=\"Wraithlord\"></p>\n<p>Not bad for my first time. I also was able to magnetize the majority of the weapons so I can swap them out in the future (I truly am blindly following whatever is on the Warhammer 40k subreddit).</p>\n<p>Next on my list is purchasing some Grey Knights. They seem like super paladins, which is very on brand for me. RIP Irmaâ€™s army.</p>\n<p>To keep up with the theme of complicated color schemes, Iâ€™m going to try painting their armor as damascus steel. Plain steel seems too boring.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finished my first, almost 500 point army!","date":"July 26, 2020","description":"Got into Warhammer 40k during the quarantine and I've been hooked ever since.
