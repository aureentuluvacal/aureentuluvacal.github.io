Right now thereâ€™s 5 employees, including me, so itâ€™s small as hell. And of course that also means Iâ€™m wearing 10 different hats: software engineer, devops engineer, product manager, project manager, designer, etc.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s a lot to handle, especially since Iâ€™ve never done it before. But the good thing is that Iâ€™ve learned more since in the last 4 months than any previous job because Iâ€™ve literally have had to figure it all out through trial and error and itâ€™s allowed me to grow fast. Itâ€™s also an extreme mindset shift from being an individual contributor at Lessonly, especially now that I am a manager.</p>\n<p>I was (and am still) so used to picking up a story, writing code that meets the acceptance criteria, getting it QAed and merged into master, then doing it all over again. I mean, I still do that, but even with all the other roles I have to play, it was still just me being an individual contributor. However, in August we hired a junior software engineer who is my first ever direct report. I think out of everything, learning how to be an effective manager is the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever had to do.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m gonna be honest and admit that Iâ€™m pretty terrible at it right now, but Iâ€™m reading books and articles and talking with my awesome CEO about effective management to get better at it. So hereâ€™s hoping in three months I can say that September was the worst management month Iâ€™ll have.</p>\n<p>Also, going forward I want to try to document things that Iâ€™ve learned (I have a massive backlog of posts already) and things Iâ€™m struggling with. Iâ€™ll try not to abandon my blog for another four months again.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸŽ‰ I'm a CTO Now! ðŸŽ‰","date":"September 11, 2019","description":"I haven't written anything in like 8 years but that's because right as I was trying to wrap up my Maxwell's equations series in May, I interviewed for a CTO position and got it!","subtitle":null,"tags":["Personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/job-update/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/learning-rust/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I Learned Rust!","subtitle":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/troubleshooting-db-cpu-error/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Troubleshooting Rails Database Connection Issue","subtitle":null}}}},
