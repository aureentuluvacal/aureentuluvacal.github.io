However, my mentor recommended against it, because I’d be closing the door on networking opportunities and who knows what else. I understand their point and wish that they weren’t right, but I did end up reactivating. Oh well.</p>\n<p>The silver lining of this situation, though, is my new site. I recently rewrote it all using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>. It’s nothing crazy; I just used the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">Gatsby Starter Blog</a>, installed a plugin for <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-katex/\">Katex</a> and tweaked a few things. You can find the code <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/caryssaperez/caryssaperez.gitlab.io\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>My old site used Jekyll and had a bit too much going on that I never wanted to add anything to it. Now it’s just a blog. No sad, emaciated portfolio that I’m neglecting, or overly long <em>About Me</em> page. Just me and my thoughts.</p>\n<p>I think that introduces a lot of self-consciousness, where I feel pressured to write things that are thoughtful and perfect. However, this blog is for me, ultimately, and I want to leverage it as my (mostly) professional diary. As busy as my life is, writing helps me ground myself, so I’ll try to write a post at least every two weeks. I’m not the expert in any field, but I am damn good at what I do, and I hope anyone reading future posts can learn from my mistakes and stories.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Goals for this Blog","date":"May 09, 2020","description":"I wrote my last blog post last year.
