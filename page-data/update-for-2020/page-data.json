We hired a new dev and a designer and are almost finished with version 3 of our engine (which is our product’s core). Sounds like just two things but between the training, planning, redesigns, allocation of work, and actual development, I don’t really recall the past two months in detail.</p>\n<p>In other words, it’s been busy as fuck.</p>\n<p>I welcome it, though, because after our 3 month feature freeze to address technical debt, we’re paying down even more debt by redoing something that’s been a struggle to manage for years. I can’t really go into detail about the architecture of the new engine but holy shit, is it easier to understand. We’re releasing it next week!</p>\n<p>On a more personal note, I’ve started learning French because I saw <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em> one time (cries in lesbian), finished my Grey Knight army so Irma and I can finally play 40K and shoot each other, and bought an iPad to get back to digital painting. I’m tossing around the idea of putting a gallery or creating a new Art tag on this site. I don’t want to do commissions because it makes painting feel like work and I already work enough.</p>\n<p>As far as posting goes, I’m going to start on an overview of electrical components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) since I finished the Maxwell’s Equations series. I also plan on doing more math based posts so my math doesn’t get rusty.</p>\n<p>This post is a reminder to myself to keep writing.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Update for the remainder of the year","date":"October 24, 2020","description":"Been a while since a posted so here's an update!","subtitle":null,"tags":["Personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/update-for-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/graphql-fun/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GraphQL and Schema Stitching","subtitle":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Woops","subtitle":null}}}},
